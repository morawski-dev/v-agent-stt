# Reference Transcriptions (Ground Truth)

## Purpose

To evaluate the quality of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) within this Proof of Concept (POC), we need to calculate **Word Error Rate (WER)**.

WER is computed by comparing the transcript generated by the ASR system with a **reference transcription (ground truth)** — a correct and faithful record of what was actually said during the conversation.

Without ground truth transcriptions, it is **not possible** to calculate WER.

## Ground Truth Requirements

Ideally, **customer should provide reference transcriptions together with the audio recordings**.  
If this is not possible, we will need to manually prepare **high-quality, accurate transcriptions** for a subset of the recordings.

This subset (gold set) should initially contain **30–50 conversations**.

## Representativeness of the Gold Set

To ensure the gold set is representative, conversations should be diversified across the following dimensions:

- **Call length**: short vs. long conversations
- **Agents**: different consultants
- **Audio quality**:
    - clean audio
    - noisy background
    - overlapping speech
- **Topics**:
    - cards
    - loans
    - electronic banking
    - other relevant banking topics

## Sample Size Considerations

WER can vary significantly between individual conversations.  
A small or biased sample may distort the overall result (e.g. selecting only very easy or very difficult calls).

For this reason, it may be necessary to **expand the gold set over time** by an additional **20–30 conversations** to improve statistical reliability.

## Why Ground Truth Is Critical

Without reference transcriptions, we can only rely on **proxy or subjective assessments**, such as:

- “It sounds good / bad”
- “Some fragments look correct”

These are **not objective metrics** and are insufficient for making a hard decision such as:

> *“Do we deliver or not?”*

Only a properly computed **WER based on ground truth** enables an objective and defensible evaluation of the ASR system.

## Transcription Guidelines (Template for Annotators)

To ensure consistency and reliable WER calculation, **all transcriptions must strictly follow the rules below**.  
Text normalization is **critical** — even small inconsistencies can significantly impact WER.

### 1. Text Normalization (Very Important)

Use **one consistent format** throughout all transcriptions:

- Preserve **capitalization**
- Preserve **punctuation** (periods, commas, question marks) — consistently everywhere
- No double spaces
- No emojis or decorative symbols

**OK**
```
Dzień dobry, proszę Pana. W czym mogę pomóc?
```

**NOT OK**
```
dzień dobry proszę pana w czym mogę pomóc
```

### 2. Numbers

- Always write numbers **in words**

**OK**
```
dwadzieścia trzy złote
```

**NOT OK**
```
23 zł
```

### 3. Abbreviations, Dates, Time

- Keep **abbreviations** as abbreviations
- Write **time in words**, for example:
```
piętnasta trzydzieści
```

### 4. Fillers and Hesitations

- Transcribe fillers and hesitations consistently:
    - `yyy`, `eee`, `no`, `yyy no`

Do not remove them and do not normalize them differently across files.

### 5. Unclear or Unintelligible Fragments

- Do **not guess**
- Use the following tag instead:
```
[unintelligible]
```

### 6. Overlapping Speech

- If multiple speakers talk at the same time:
    - Transcribe **only the dominant speaker**
